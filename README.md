Translations:

* Make sure all your commits are put into the "development" branch, if we were to merge your PR.
* Make sure that there is accuracy in your translation, proper grammar (use formal words, if applicable), no phrases left out, that sorta thing.
* You can base your translations on any of the existing translations, as these are approved.
* Make sure the file is in the i18n folder and named "<language>.json"
* If you wanna put in the extra mile, put the proper code to load the language into i18n.js, however, this is not required.
* Make sure that the "_name" value exists with the English translation of your language's name in all lowercase.
